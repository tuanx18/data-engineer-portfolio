##### Part 5 - Introduction to Functions: Learning about Table-Returned Functions *(Query 201 to 250)*
- **URL**: [Part 5 - Introduction to Functions: Learning about Table-Returned Functions](https://github.com/tuanx18/ds-sql-projects/blob/main/AW-Project-Part-5.sql)
- **Description**: Part 5 introduces the concept of SQL functions returning tables. These functions are designed to retrieve specific sets of data from the employee database based on various input parameters. They employ a range of SQL techniques such as string manipulation, numeric comparisons, and conditional filtering to extract information. The functions are diverse, tackling different aspects of data retrieval. These functions offer a deeper understanding of how to use SQL functions to create tailored queries, leveraging parameters to extract precise datasets. This set of exercises demonstrates the versatility of SQL functions in isolating targeted information from complex databases.

##### Part 6 - Dynamic SQL and Stored Procedures *(Query 251 to 300)*
- **URL**: [Part 6 - Dynamic SQL and Stored Procedures](https://github.com/tuanx18/ds-sql-projects/blob/main/AW-Project-Part-6.sql)
- **Description**: In this section, the focus shifts towards leveraging the power of dynamic SQL, stored procedures, and variable manipulation within SQL Server. The exercises delve into the realm of dynamic SQL, allowing for the creation and execution of SQL statements at runtime. Participants will engage with stored procedures, a powerful feature that encapsulates SQL logic for reuse and efficient management. The exercises showcase the usage of DECLARE and SET to handle variables within SQL Server procedures. These variables allow for the storage and manipulation of values, enabling dynamic control over queries and stored procedure behavior. Additionally, the concept of EXEC (Execute) is introduced, demonstrating its use to run dynamic SQL statements or execute stored procedures within other procedures. The tasks within this part emphasize the importance and utility of dynamic SQL in constructing adaptable and flexible queries, especially in scenarios where SQL statements need to be generated based on varying conditions or user inputs.

##### Part 7 - Advanced Procedures and Function Problems *(Query 301 to 350)*
- **URL**: [Part 7 - Advanced Procedures and Function Problems](https://github.com/tuanx18/ds-sql-projects/blob/main/AW-Project-Part-7.sql)
- **Description**: Part 7 explores SQL functions' power to return tables or specific values and delves into dynamic SQL concepts. It introduces COALESCE for handling NULL values effectively and demonstrates TRY_CAST's safe data type conversion. Additionally, it covers CROSS APPLY, enabling the combination of rows from multiple tables. These exercises deepen understanding of functions' versatility, NULL value management, safe type conversions, and advanced querying techniques like CROSS APPLY.

- **Main Knowledge**: ***FUNCTIONS Return Tables/Values, Dynamic SQL, COALESCE, TRY_CAST, CROSS APPLY***

##### Part 8 - The Art of SQL Logic: Looping Techniques and Conditional Structures *(Query 351 to 400)*
- **URL**: [Part 8 - The Art of SQL Logic: Looping Techniques and Conditional Structures](https://github.com/tuanx18/ds-sql-projects/blob/main/AW-Project-Part-8.sql)
- **Description**: While loops and basic logics were barely mentioned in the previous parts, part 9 is dedicated to helping learners grasp logic and develop a problem-solving mindset about loops and conditions. This section shows all the knowledge required to understand the concepts of WHILE and IF, but it does so with a smaller focus on tables and data than the previous sections. Despite the fact that many challenges were developed uniquely and that task requirements may have been similar, solving them required a great deal of critical thinking. Furthermore, the BIT, also known as "Booleans" in other programming languages, which are either 1 (True) or 0 (False), also caused some of the very first problems with this section. In combination with the complex use of Subqueries and 'WHERE EXISTS,' this section enhances the problem solving mechanism.
